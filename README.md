##### Fun Facts:
I am a sports fanatic but specifically a **die hard Blues fan**. I have been to about 40 games in the last 3 years and have only not watched a handful of games in that stretch. I am a <em>math major</em> with little computer science experience but am looking forward to the challenge of this class
